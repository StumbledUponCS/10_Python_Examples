# Exponential Distribution
# Exponential distribution is used for describing time till next event e.g. failure/success etc.

# It has two parameters:

# scale - inverse of rate ( see lam in poisson distribution ) defaults to 1.0.

# size - The shape of the returned array.

# Example
# Draw out a sample for exponential distribution with 2.0 scale with 2x3 size:
